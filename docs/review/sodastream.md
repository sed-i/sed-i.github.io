How does sodastream compare to club soda in terms of pricing?

<!--more-->

I used a sodastream "60L cylinder" (14.5 oz / 410 g / 0.63 &ell; CO2) to carbonate small (450 m&ell;) and large (840 m&ell;) bottles, and recorded how many of each I carbonated (three "buzzes" per bottle):

|     | 450 ml | 840 ml | Total vol.  |
|-----|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1   | 20     | 16     | 22.44 &ell; |
| 2   | 9      | 20     | 20.85 &ell; |

Assuming I forgot to record a few, let's say a single sodastream canister carbonates 25 litres of water, which means

| CO2   | Soda yield |
|-------|------------|
| 410 g | 25 &ell;   |

(which, by volume, is equivalent to 113 x 222 m&ell; cans or 70 x 355 m&ell; cans).

At the grocery store:

- club soda is priced at about 1.5-1.8 $/100m&ell;;
- a CO2 cansiter is priced at about $40, i.e. 40 / (250 * 100 ml) = 0.16 $/100m&ell; of soda.

So sodastream is:

- 10 times cheaper than cans (yet more bubbly than cans);
- significantly reducing your trash volume.
