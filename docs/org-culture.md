## Elon Musk's 5-step protocol[^1]
1. Make the requirements less dumb.
2. Try and delete part of the process.
3. Simplify and optimize the design (don't optimize something that shouldn't exist).
4. Accelerate cycle time (but donâ€™t go faster until you've worked on the other three things first).
5. Automate (if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process testing).
